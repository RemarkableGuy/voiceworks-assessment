This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction
This is an React project to fetch tank data from a mock API and filter that data using drop downs. This project was created as an answer to the assessment I received from Voiceworks. This is the first time i've ever used React so it was an interesting learning experience.    

## Available Scripts
To run the app in dev mode, run:
### `npm start` or `yarn start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## TODO
- [ ] Write some tests
- [x] Finish the UI
- [ ] Refactor and add documentation/comments
